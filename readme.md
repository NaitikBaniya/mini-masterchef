This is a classic chicken dish and enjoyed best when served hot. You can also garnish it with cream and green chillies just before serving.
We have a huge variety of recipes when it comes to Indian chicken curries so you never run out of options.
If you are a health conscious chicken lover, we have got you covered even then with our delicious Low Fat Butter Chicken.
You could make a vegetarian version of the dish by simple replacing chicken with pieces of paneer. Marinate the paneer for 5-6 hours too to ensure there is enough flavour in them before putting them in the oven or tandoor.
